.Net-QR-Decoder
===============

The notion of the presented C# code is to illustrate the basic steps need to be taken for .Net developers to build a simple QR Decoder, and show them how to use the famous zxing library to decode 2D barcode library realtime, either by capturing pictures from a webcam or by uploading a static 2D barcode picture.

The code uses AForge.dll as a Webcam video streaming library. Make sure to add AForge as a reference if its somehow was removed. By default this library should be included inside the .Net project.
